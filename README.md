# Salary-Market-Analysis-Based-on-Job-Categories-Job-Levels-and-Regions

# Introduction
Salary represents the financial compensation provided by companies to employees in return for the work they perform. Salary amounts are typically agreed upon at the beginning of an employment contract and paid regularly. Information on salary ranges is crucial for both job seekers and employers as a basis for setting expectations and negotiating fair compensation aligned with the labor market.

# Problem Statement
The web scraping process from the Jobstreet platform produced 32,976 rows of data containing information such as job titles, company names, locations, and average salaries. However, the raw data alone does not provide a comprehensive picture of the salary landscape. To extract meaningful insights, the data needs to be grouped into job categories, job levels, and regions, enabling clearer identification of salary patterns in the Indonesian labor market.

# Goals
To present an overview of average salary distributions by grouping the data into job categories, job levels, and regions, thereby providing structured and easy-to-understand insights.

# Methodology
1. Data Cleansing
Identifying and correcting incomplete, duplicate, inconsistent, or invalid data to improve dataset quality and accuracy.
2. Data Wrangling
Transforming the raw data into a structured dataset through processes such as job category mapping, format normalization, and data type adjustments.
3. Descriptive Statistics
Applying descriptive statistical methods to calculate averages, distributions, and summary statistics for each job category, job level, and region.
4. Data Visualization
Presenting the results using charts and visualizations to make it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in salary data.

# Analysis Results
1. Based on Job Category
Insight: Jobs requiring advanced hard skills, professional certifications, or foreign language expertise tend to offer the highest salaries, while administrative and basic operational roles fall into the lower salary range.
2. Based on Job Level
Insight: There is a consistent increase in salary with higher job levels, indicating a linear compensation structure aligned with rising responsibilities.
3. Based on Region (Province)
Insight: Jakarta and mining-centric regions like West Papua, Central Sulawesi, and NTB offer higher salaries due to dominant industries (mining, oil & gas) and higher living costs. Yogyakarta records the lowest salaries because its economy is driven by the education sector and SMEs.
4. Based on Region (Island)
Insight: Java, as Indonesia’s economic hub, offers the highest average salaries. Papua and Kalimantan also show higher salaries due to the prevalence of mining and energy sectors. Meanwhile, regions such as Maluku and Bali–NTB have lower salaries due to the dominance of tourism and service-sector jobs.

# Conclusion
The salary analysis based on web-scraped data from Jobstreet provides several insights regarding differences in average salaries by job category, job level, and region. Overall, the results indicate that:
1. Job type and skill level significantly influence salary levels. Highly specialized roles—such as healthcare professionals, translators, IT & Data specialists, and management—tend to offer higher average salaries compared to administrative or basic operational roles.
2. Job level shows a linear salary pattern. Salary consistently increases from internship to manager/executive levels, reflecting compensation aligned with increasing responsibility.
3. Work location is another key factor. Provinces and islands with major industrial centers—such as DKI Jakarta, Kalimantan, Papua, and the Riau Islands—show higher average salaries. In contrast, regions driven by education or small businesses, such as Yogyakarta, tend to have lower salary levels.

However, this analysis should not be treated as a definitive reference for the Indonesian salary market due to several limitations:
1. The data comes from only one job platform, which may not fully represent Indonesia’s overall job market across different industries and recruitment channels.
2. Job titles are free-text, resulting in wide naming variations that may affect the accuracy of job category grouping.
3. Category mapping still requires ongoing refinement, especially as new job titles emerge and industry dynamics evolve.
The analysis relies solely on descriptive statistics and does not account for factors such as work experience, company size, specific industries, or non-salary benefits.
Thus, while the results offer a useful initial overview of salary patterns, additional validation is needed before using them for more formal or strategic decision-making.
